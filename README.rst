Configuration
-------------

If you would like to change options passed to the actual players just
edit the ``PLAYERS`` list at the end of the cplay script.

Miscellaneous
-------------

A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will have to be
local. For mpeg streaming, ``splay`` is recommended.

It is also possible to pipe a playlist to ``cplay``, as stdin will be
reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

Remote control via ``/tmp/cplay-control-$USER``; see ``lircrc``.
