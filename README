Description:

Installation:

        make install

Usage:

        cplay [-nrRv] [ file | dir | playlist ] ...

        When in doubt, press 'h' for a friendly help page.

Configuration:

        If you would like to change options passed to the actual players
        just edit the PLAYERS list in the cplay script.

Miscellaneous:

        A playlist can contain URLs, but the playlist itself will
        have to be local. For mpeg streaming, splay is recommended.

        It is also possible to pipe a playlist to cplay, as stdin
        will be reopened on startup unless it is attached to a tty.

        Remote control via /tmp/cplay-control-$USER; see lircrc.
